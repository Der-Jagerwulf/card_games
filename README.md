Card Games

Basically I had the idea to create a program that could randomly generate a hand of card, and display it.

Since it's worlink stably enough, I'm planning on creating games to use said card-creation code and apply it, wich is a challenge cause each card game has specific rules about what is revelant to said game, be it the mere card value, its suits, or both.
